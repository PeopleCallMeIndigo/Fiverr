                    <p class="info-container-text">Mathematical analysis is an area of ​​mathematics that studies the behavior of real numbers (which are the basis on which analysis in mathematics starts) and complex numbers. It also covers the constructions that are obtained from these numbers, such as functions, series, sequences, continuity, limits and convergence as well as the branches of integration and derivability.</p>

                    <p class="info-container-text">Functions are rules that relate the elements of one set to the elements of a second set. When a magnitude depends on another, it is said that it is a function of it. A function f is a relation that assigns to the elements of a first set (initial set X) an element of a second set (final set Y). To each element of X there corresponds one and only one element of Y.</p>

                    <p class="info-container-text">The element x of the first set is the independent variable. It is a value that is previously set. The letter y is the dependent variable and corresponds to the elements of the final set. This variable depends on the value of the independent variable x. f(x) is called the image of x, while x is called the anti-image of f(x).</p>

                    <p class="info-container-text">The notion of limits refers in colloquial terms to what our intuition leads us to: it is what we can get closer to as long as we want.</p>
                    <p class="info-container-text">
                        The limit is a very important notion in mathematical calculation. Fundamental for areas, continuity, asymptotes, convergence, derivatives or integrals.</p>
                    <p class="info-container-text">In the limit of a function, the keys are the variable x and the different values ​​that the function f(x) acquires. In the limit of a sequence, the equivalence of the role of x is the index n, while the an terms of the sequence would be equivalent to the role of the values ​​of f(x).</p>
                    <p class="info-container-text">Limit formally defines that value when we approach a certain point, both for the limit of a function and for the limit of a sequence.</p>
                    <p class="info-container-text">In mathematics, the limit of a function at a point or that of a sequence is the unique value that the function approaches when the independent variable x approaches, as close as we want, to a set value or is the term of a sequence when the index n tends to infinity.</p>
                    <p class="info-container-text">In a function, if we call the value of the limit L and the point to which the independent variable tends we call it a, the expression of the limit would be:</p>

                    <p class="info-container-text">The limit, if it exists, does not require that the value f(a) exist in the function, even if the limit tends to it. It can also happen that the value of the function at the point x = a is a different value from the limit sought. As in this case, in which the limit L exists even if the value f(a) does not exist in this function:</p>

                    </div>

                    <p class="info-container-text">Apart from tending x to a finite number a, there may be limits in which x tends to +∞ (in which we will approach +∞ from the left of the real line), to -∞ (in which we will approach +∞ to the right) or, generically, to ∞. They are the limits in infinity.</p>

                    <p class="info-container-text">When the function tends to get indefinitely large towards positive or negative values, we are in a case of infinite limits.</p>

                    <p class="info-container-text">Derivatives are a part of mathematical analysis that play a very important role in mathematics, physics, engineering or social sciences. Describes how quickly a given function changes when its independent variables change. The calculation of the derivative of a function falls within the infinitesimal calculus together with the integral calculus. The notion of derivative of a mathematical function f(x) is closely related to that of a limit. There are many applications of the derivative. The derivative is essential to find maximums and minimums, increase or decrease of a function, the application of l'Hôpital's rule to calculate certain limits, etc.</p>

The derivative function of f(x) will be f'(x), which will relate each real number x0 in the domain with the value of the derivative of f(x) at x0, that is, with each value of f'(x0) . The function is represented by the expression:</p>
